Obi-Wan - It's over Anakin, I have the high ground.
Anakin - You underestimate my power.
Obi-Wan - Don't try it.
[Obi-Wan slices Anakin's legs with a light saber]
Obi-Wan - You were the chosen one.
Obi-Wan - It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them.
Obi-Wan - Bring ballance to the force, not leave it in darkness.
Anakin - I hate you!!!
Obi-Wan - You were my brother Anakin, I loved you.
